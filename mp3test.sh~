# A simple shell script for MP3 to generate data for performance analysis
#
# This script should run in the range from about 12 to 30 seconds.  If the
#    run time is much longer then there is a bug in your lab3 sorts.  If
#    the run time is much shorter, then you need to increase the size
#    of the lists (see "sizes" below).
#
# There are two options to execute this file: either make the file executable
#    or run the file in a new shell.
#
# Option 1:  In a terminal type:
#      chmod +x mp3test.sh
#      ./mp3test.sh
#
# Option 2: run the program sh (this is a command shell) and tell sh to read
#    the commands from the file mp3test.sh
#     sh mp3test.sh
#
# There are four tests for:
#    Insertion Sort, Recursive Selection Sort, Iterative Selection Sort, and
#    Merge Sort
#
# Each sort is run with random, ascending, and decending lists.
# 
# "sizes" is a set of values for the list size selected for each trial
#
# TEST 1 Insertion sort
